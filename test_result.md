All four endpoints (GET /api/expense-categories/, GET /api/expense-folders/, GET /api/expenses/, and GET /api/expenses/statistics) are working correctly. The endpoints return the expected data with all required fields and the filtering functionality works as expected. The frontend should be able to integrate with these endpoints without any issues."

      message: "I've reviewed the frontend components for the Expense Management feature. Based on code review, all components (ExpenseOverview, ExpenseList, ExpenseConfig, ExpenseCategoryManager, and ExpenseFolderManager) are properly implemented with appropriate error handling, loading states, and user interactions. The components correctly integrate with the backend API endpoints that have been verified to work. While I couldn't perform interactive testing through Playwright due to environment constraints, the code quality and integration with working API endpoints suggest that the frontend components should function as expected."
