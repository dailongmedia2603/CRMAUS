The search is case-insensitive, working with both lowercase and uppercase queries. The search functionality also works correctly when combined with other filters (e.g., status). Found an interesting edge case with Vietnamese characters: searching for 'Dai' doesn't match 'Đại' due to character differences, which is expected behavior."
