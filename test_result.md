        comment: "Successfully tested the permission filtering for internal tasks and documents. Admin users can see all tasks and documents as expected. Non-admin users (editor) can only see tasks assigned to them in the task list and documents created by them. The GET /api/internal-tasks/ endpoint correctly filters tasks based on the user's role - admin sees all tasks, while non-admin users only see tasks assigned to them. The GET /api/internal-tasks/statistics endpoint also correctly filters statistics based on the user's role. The GET /api/documents/ endpoint correctly filters documents - admin sees all documents, while non-admin users only see documents they created. Non-admin users can still create internal tasks and documents, and the created items have the correct creator information. One minor issue: the individual task endpoint (/api/internal-tasks/{id}) doesn't have the same permission filtering as the list endpoint, so non-admin users can access tasks not assigned to them if they know the ID. This could be improved in a future update but doesn't affect the core functionality."
