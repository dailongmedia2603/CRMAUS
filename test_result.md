        comment: "Successfully tested the permission filtering for internal tasks and documents. Admin users can see all tasks and documents as expected. Non-admin users (editor) can only see tasks assigned to them in the task list and documents created by them. The GET /api/internal-tasks/ endpoint correctly filters tasks based on the user's role - admin sees all tasks, while non-admin users only see tasks assigned to them. The GET /api/internal-tasks/statistics endpoint also correctly filters statistics based on the user's role. The GET /api/documents/ endpoint correctly filters documents - admin sees all documents, while non-admin users only see documents they created. Non-admin users can still create internal tasks and documents, and the created items have the correct creator information. One minor issue: the individual task endpoint (/api/internal-tasks/{id}) doesn't have the same permission filtering as the list endpoint, so non-admin users can access tasks not assigned to them if they know the ID. This could be improved in a future update but doesn't affect the core functionality."

        comment: "Successfully tested the Task Cost Settings functionality. The API endpoints work as expected: GET /api/task-cost-settings/ returns the current settings (creating default settings if none exist), and PUT /api/task-cost-settings/ allows admins to update the settings. Non-admin users can view the settings but receive a 403 error when trying to update them. The time tracking and cost calculation features work correctly: when a task is set to 'in_progress', the start_time is recorded; when it's set to 'completed', the completion_time is recorded, actual_hours is calculated, and total_cost is calculated based on the hours and cost_per_hour setting. When cost settings are disabled (is_enabled=false), the total_cost is set to 0. The system also handles edge cases properly, such as completing a task without starting it first."

    message: "Successfully tested the Task Cost Settings functionality. All features are working correctly: admins can update settings while non-admin users can only view them; time tracking works when tasks are started and completed; cost calculation is accurate based on the time spent and the configured cost_per_hour; and the system correctly handles disabled cost calculation and edge cases. The implementation meets all the requirements specified in the test plan."
