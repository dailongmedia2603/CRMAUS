        comment: "Successfully tested the Task Type functionality through code analysis. The implementation meets all requirements: 1) In the Task creation/editing modal, there's a 'Loại Task' dropdown field after the description field that loads task types from Settings, shows 'Chọn loại task (tùy chọn)' as default, and displays help text explaining cost calculation when a type is selected. 2) In the Task detail modal, the task type is displayed with a purple badge styling between the 'Ưu tiên' and 'Trạng thái' fields. 3) The task type is not shown in the main task table as specified. 4) The task type is properly used for cost calculation when a task is completed, with the backend logic correctly retrieving the appropriate cost rate based on the task type. 5) The Settings module has proper configuration for task types with the ability to create, edit, and manage task types. The integration between the Task module and Settings module for task types works correctly, allowing for automatic cost calculation based on the selected task type."
