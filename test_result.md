        comment: "Successfully tested the Time Filter tabs functionality. The dropdown shows all three tabs: Năm (Year), Quý (Quarter), and Tháng (Month). All tabs are clickable and active. The Year tab works correctly, showing a dropdown to select the year. The Quarter and Month tabs are also working properly, each showing the appropriate dropdowns for selection. The UI updates correctly when switching between tabs."
