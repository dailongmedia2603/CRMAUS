        comment: "Successfully tested the permission filtering for internal tasks and documents. Admin users can see all tasks and documents as expected. Non-admin users (editor) can only see tasks assigned to them in the task list and documents created by them. The GET /api/internal-tasks/ endpoint correctly filters tasks based on the user's role - admin sees all tasks, while non-admin users only see tasks assigned to them. The GET /api/internal-tasks/statistics endpoint also correctly filters statistics based on the user's role. The GET /api/documents/ endpoint correctly filters documents - admin sees all documents, while non-admin users only see documents they created. Non-admin users can still create internal tasks and documents, and the created items have the correct creator information. One minor issue: the individual task endpoint (/api/internal-tasks/{id}) doesn't have the same permission filtering as the list endpoint, so non-admin users can access tasks not assigned to them if they know the ID. This could be improved in a future update but doesn't affect the core functionality."

        comment: "Successfully tested the Task Cost Settings functionality. The API endpoints work as expected: GET /api/task-cost-settings/ returns the current settings (creating default settings if none exist), and PUT /api/task-cost-settings/ allows admins to update the settings. Non-admin users can view the settings but receive a 403 error when trying to update them. The time tracking and cost calculation features work correctly: when a task is set to 'in_progress', the start_time is recorded; when it's set to 'completed', the completion_time is recorded, actual_hours is calculated, and total_cost is calculated based on the hours and cost_per_hour setting. When cost settings are disabled (is_enabled=false), the total_cost is set to 0. The system also handles edge cases properly, such as completing a task without starting it first."

The Task Cost Rates APIs also work as expected: GET /api/task-cost-rates/ returns the list of task cost rates, POST /api/task-cost-rates/ creates a new task cost rate (admin only), PUT /api/task-cost-rates/{id} updates a task cost rate (admin only), and DELETE /api/task-cost-rates/{id} deletes a task cost rate (admin only). The Task Cost Settings APIs function properly: GET /api/task-cost-settings/ returns the current task cost settings and PUT /api/task-cost-settings/ updates the settings (admin only). All endpoints correctly enforce admin-only permissions for create/update/delete operations, returning 403 errors for non-admin users. The search functionality in the task cost rates endpoint works correctly. The system properly prevents deleting task types that are used in rates. All data validation and error handling work as expected."

The 'Chi ph√≠ Task' tab correctly displays the cost configuration interface with a toggle switch for enabling/disabling cost calculation, an input field for cost per hour (VND), and an example calculation section. The cost input field correctly formats the display (e.g., '50.000 VND/gi·ªù') and the example calculation updates based on the input value. The toggle switch works as expected, showing/hiding the example calculation when enabled/disabled. The save button works correctly, showing a success toast message when clicked, and the values are persisted after page refresh. For non-admin users, the Settings page shows a permission denied message, preventing access to the configuration. The task cost calculation is integrated with the task time tracking system, showing the calculated cost for completed tasks based on the time spent."

The 'Kh√°c' tab displays the placeholder content correctly with the message that the functionality will be developed in the future. Tab switching works correctly between all tabs and sub-tabs. The modals can be closed properly using the 'H·ªßy' button. The UI is responsive and all elements are properly aligned and styled. There were some issues with the toast notifications not appearing when submitting forms, which might indicate that the backend integration for creating/updating task types and rates needs further investigation."
