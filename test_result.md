      message: "I've tested all the expense management API endpoints required by the ExpenseComponents.js frontend code. All four endpoints (GET /api/expense-categories/, GET /api/expense-folders/, GET /api/expenses/, and GET /api/expenses/statistics) are working correctly. The endpoints return the expected data with all required fields and the filtering functionality works as expected. The frontend should be able to integrate with these endpoints without any issues."
